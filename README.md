CRUD Tourism Web-App that uses Scala, React, and ML to give tourists suggestions

In our current M1 iteration of our Berlin travel website, we have create a fully functioning registration page, complete with all the components of an account including an administrator designation. Furthermore, we have allowed the user to edit their account info and encrypted any senesitive information. Finally, the user can safely log on and off their account.


IMPORTANT NOTE: When registering, if you click on register as admin, and you type in an incorrect password, you will be registered but not as an admin. Default password in there is incorrect. If you do type the correct password, you will be registered as an admin. This can be seen because the welcome page will say Welcome ADMIN __ ___ instead of the normal Welcome __ __

ADMIN PASSWORD: scalaisthefuture
