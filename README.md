# visit-berlin-app
CRUD Tourism Web-App that uses Scala, React, and ML to give tourists suggestions

In our current M1 iteration of our Berlin travel website, we have create a fully functioning registration page, complete with all the components of an account including an administrator designation. Furthermore, we have allowed the user to edit their account info and encrypted any senesitive information. Finally, the user can safely log on and off their account.
Besides these capabilities, however, we have not built a fully constructed "Contact" and "About" pages yet. These will be completed in our M2 iteration along with the other objectives specified.
